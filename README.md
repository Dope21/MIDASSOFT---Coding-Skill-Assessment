# Merge

- This function writen by `Typescript` and `Jest` for unit tests.
- The problem states that inputs are integer lists, Iâ€™ve assumed all values will be integers and omitted additional type checks.
- The function should still behave correctly with floating-point numbers.

## Setup
```sh
npm install
```

## Run
```sh
npm start
```

## Test
```sh
npm test
```
